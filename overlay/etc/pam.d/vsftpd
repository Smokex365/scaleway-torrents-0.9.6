# Standard behaviour for ftpd(8).
auth    required        pam_listfile.so item=user sense=deny file=/etc/ftpusers onerr=succeed

# Note: vsftpd handles anonymous logins on its own. Do not enable pam_ftp.so.

###
### Added by Scaleway, to handle vsftpd PAM authentication with htpasswd
###

# vsftpd, in sysdeputil.c (in vsf_sysdep_check_auth()):
# - calls `pam_authenticate` to validate the PAM type "auth"
# - calls `pam_acct_mgmt` to validate the PAM type "account"
# - if SESSION_SUPPORT=YES (NO by default), calls `pam_open_session` to
#   validate the PAM type "session"
#
# If one of these calls returns an error, the authentication fails.
#
# We want to grant access if the user is in /var/www/credentials or if the user
# is in /etc/passwd.

# If the module pam_pwdfile returns SUCCESS, stop processing the "auth" PAM
# type and return SUCCESS. Otherwise, let common- configuration handle
# /etc/passwd authentication.
auth    sufficient  pam_pwdfile.so pwdfile=/var/www/credentials

# Make the "account" PAM type always return SUCCESS, which is not a security
# issue since the type is only processed if the type "auth" succeeded.
account sufficient  pam_permit.so

# common- configuration grant access for the PAM type "session", so there's
# nothing to do.
